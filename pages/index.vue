              We have a Slack workspace to connect people who are involved with the Edmonton (YEG)
              tech scene. The people here range from being developers, designers, PM's, students,
              hobbists and more who love to talk about code. We also do events and network across
              Alberta.
              <br><br>
              There are several channels that you can check out on the card. They range from being
              about a specific meetup, tech news, tech help, finding new opportunities, casual
              chatting and more. We have 80+ other channels! If there's any channels we're missing
              all members are free to create any they want. If they're inactive for a few months,
              then they'll be deleted. Connect with other members of the community by joining the
              workspace.
