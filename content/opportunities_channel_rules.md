# Opportunities Channel Rules

<br>

We have an [#opportunities channel](https://devedmonton.slack.com/archives/CCL88S2CX) in our slack and we love when people post job opportunities to find great local talent but we want to add some rules to combat some of the spam posts we see.

<br>

## What is allowed to be posted:

Either a post outlining all of these things or a link to a job posting that has all of these things:

- A brief description of your company, and the title/role of the job.
- Remote, in-office or hybrid?
- Positions available to Albertans and especially Edmontonians. Posts advertising jobs that do not hire Canadians will be taken down
- Optional but encouraged: Salary range for this role

## What is not allowed to be posted:

- Companies that are not hiring Canadians
- Multi-Level-Marketing schemes
- Vague posts that do not describe the work you will be doing or a salary range
