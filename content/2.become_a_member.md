# Become a Member

<br>

Thank you for your interest in becoming a DES member! Firstly we would like to point out that **you do not need to be a member to use the DES Slack, attend meetups and events, or to join the monthly society meeting and AGM.**

Any member of the public is welcome to:

- Join the Edmonton developer community
- Chat on our Slack
- Attend DES supported meetups and events
- Come out to DES monthly planning meetings
- Participate in Working Groups

Membership is only required to:

- Vote on society business
- Borrow DES equipment (cameras, mics, etc.)
- Use the DES resources (like our YouTube channel or streaming tools)
- Start an event or group officially supported by DES
- Use the DES name or branding
- Champion a Working Group
- Give us $20/year to support the work we do (thank you!)

If you're still interested in becoming a member, please complete the form below and then e-transfer $20 to memberships@devedmonton.com. Membership fee's are to be paid annually (we will remind you ðŸ˜› ) and if you have any questions about when your membership expires, these can be answered from [the bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i6oXabir-628csa2bQacHpc17Kmhec9EfkyHij9yQGM/edit).
