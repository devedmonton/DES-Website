# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

Dev Edmonton Society's mission is to build an impactful, diverse, and collaborative developer community. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof) and any personal characteristics protected under [the Alberta Human Rights Act.](https://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/A25P5.pdf)

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Dev Edmonton Society to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Culture Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open culture citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

- The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:
  1. Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  2. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  3. Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  4. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  5. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or incidents of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
  6. Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
  7. Respect the privacy and dignity of other members and the public. Treat the information of others as you'd like yours to be treated.
  8. Avoid posting/messaging/approaching with the same message frequently. If something could be shared in multiple places, make sure that your message is on topic and respectful. Do not spam our members in public or in private.
      1. Please consider that just because you can share something in multiple places, doesn't mean that you should.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

- The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:
  1. Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
  2. Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  3. Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
  4. Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
  5. Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
  6. Inappropriate photography or recording.
  7. Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
  8. Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
  9. Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  10. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  11. Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
  12. Collecting or sharing personal information (including names, emails, avatars, handles, nicknames, messages, emails, or other biographical or identifying information) without explicit and prior consent.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

In an effort to build a more collaborative and inclusive community, we always endevour to resolve disputes and conduct incidents through education, dialog, and respectful communication. People who demonstrate a sincere effort to change behaviour will be given a reasonable opportunity to do so, and having done so to participate in the community, but continued incidents will not be tolerated and may result in further actions at the discretion of the community organizers.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
