        1. Purpose
      </h2>
      <p>
        Dev Edmonton Society's mission is to build an impactful,
        diverse, and collaborative developer community. As such, we
        are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
        environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual
        orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
        religion (or lack thereof) and any personal characteristics
        protected under

        the Alberta Human Rights Act</a

      <p>
        This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those
        who participate in our community, as well as the
        consequences for unacceptable behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        We invite all those who participate in Dev Edmonton Society
        to help us create safe and positive experiences for
        everyone.
      </p>
    </li>

      <h2>
        2. Open Culture Citizenship
      </h2>
      <p>
        A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase
        open culture citizenship by encouraging participants to
        recognize and strengthen the relationships between our
        actions and their effects on our community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and
        positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of
        inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure
        our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all
        participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to
        know.

      <h2>
        3. Expected Behavior
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following behaviors are expected and requested of all
        community members:
      </p>
      <ol class="multiLevelNumberNotation">
        <li class="py-1">
          Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so,
          you contribute to the health and longevity of this
          community.
        </li>
        <li class="py-1">
          Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and
          actions.
        </li>
        <li class="py-1">Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
        <li class="py-1">
          Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing
          behavior and speech.
        </li>
        <li class="py-1">
          Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow
          participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a
          dangerous situation, someone in distress, or incidents
          of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem
          inconsequential.
        </li>
        <li class="py-1">
          Remember that community event venues may be shared with
          members of the public; please be respectful to all
          patrons of these locations.
        </li>
        <li class="py-1">
          Respect the privacy and dignity of other members and the

        <li class="py-1">
          Some channels (for example, #opportunities) may have their
          own rules about how to conduct yourself. Make sure to pay
          attention to rules listed or linked in the channel topic
          and/or description.
        </li>
        <li class="py-1">
          Avoid posting/messaging/approaching with the same
          message frequently. If something could be shared in
          multiple places, make sure that your message is on topic
          and respectful. Do not spam our members in public or in
          private.
          <ol class="multiLevelNumberNotation">
            <li class="py-1">
              Please consider that just because you can share
              something in multiple places, doesn't mean that
              you should.

        5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
      </h2>
      <p>
        Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including
        sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not
        be tolerated.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an effort to build a more collaborative and inclusive
        community, we always endevour to resolve disputes and
        conduct incidents through education, dialog, and respectful
        communication. People who demonstrate a sincere effort to
        change behaviour will be given a reasonable opportunity to
        do so, and having done so to participate in the community,
        but continued incidents will not be tolerated and may result
        in further actions at the discretion of the community
        organizers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to
        comply immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the
        community organizers may take any action they deem
        appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or
        permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and
        without refund in the case of a paid event).

        (including but not limited to Slack, chats, instant
        messaging, message boards, email, forums, comments) and
        offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies

        community activities when such behavior has the potential to
        adversely affect the safety and well-being of community
        members.
